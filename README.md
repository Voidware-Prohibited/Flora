## Material and Texture Setup

All Textures are Channel Packed into the RGBA Channels. Targa (.TGA) files are used whenever useful to store data in the Alpha channel.

A Color Map is used to allow for customization of up to 3 colors per material instance.

Make Material Instances for countless color and parameter variations for use in Instanced Foliage Actors.
